NOTE: This fails because the ssh fingerprint is not known locally by the Ansible Control Manager. "FAILED => Using a SSH password instead of a key is not possible because Host Key checking is enabled and sshpass does not support this.  Please add this host's fingerprint to your known_hosts file to manage this host.
